PeerBook is a social network in which there are no points of centralisation; so if any node in the network fails, the rest will continue to run happily.

Your data is stored in a distributed fashion, across the network, so that even when you turn off your instance of PeerBook, your friends will still be able to view your Profile and send you messages.

Of course, all of this data is encrypted and backed up several times, so that even if Alice's data is being stored on Eve's machine, Eve will only be able to read it if she is Alice's friend; and Eve will only ever be able to delete her local copy of Alice's data which has no effect on its overall availability to the rest of Alice's friends.
